# ExerCYse

A collaborative exercising application dedicated toward Iowa State Students. (Soon to be deployed on a Heroku Server & the Android Application Store)

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, run a gradle build and either run it on the emulator or on a stand-alone device. If you’re an Iowa State Student, register with your ISU email and you’re good to get started.

### Prerequisites

Development Environment

```
Android Studio
IntelliJ
etc.
```

### Installing

Here’s what you need to get the application working smoothly

```
Android Device (Marshmallow OS and up)
Spotify Account (for music sharing)
Stable Internet or Cellular data connection
```

Spend some time getting connected with the community members, and start sharing your favorite workouts/music.

## What’s in the application

So now that you’ve started the application, here is how it’s broken down.

### Workouts

Within the workouts tab, you can begin to construct some of your favorite workouts and even run through them within the application. Here’s an example of what a workout would look like:

```
Workout #1 – Push-ups (10 reps, 3 sets), Sit-ups (25 reps, 5 sets), etc.

```

### Music

Within the music tab, you can login with your Spotify account and begin to listen to listen to music while within our application. Also a cool feature is adding playlists directly from the community tab into your personal Spotify account (but we’ll get there in a little bit).

### Community

Within the community tab, you have the ability to connect with other students at Iowa State. Whether you’re just getting started at working out, or you’ve been working out for awhile now, we aim to provide a general basis for all types of students. Share playlists, workouts, and even comments with other to help and encourage them in their journey of exercising.

### Reports

Within the Reports tab, students has the ability to report broken machines and/or disrespectful comments in the community tab. A super-user has the ability to overview these and either accept/refuse them. 

### Profile

Within the Profile tab, you can view either your profile, or if you click on someone else’s profile picture and view their profile that way. It’s a great way to view someone’s favorite workouts or a little bit about them as well.
